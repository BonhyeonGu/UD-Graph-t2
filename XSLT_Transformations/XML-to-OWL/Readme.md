## XML to OWL XSL Transformation
This folder contains sample data used to test the CityGML2RDF.xsl stylesheet and its resulting transformation.

Testing is done using [Saxon-HE](http://saxon.sourceforge.net/)

### GML2RDF
CityGML2RDF is an XSLT stylesheet to transform CityGML 2.0 files into RDF/XML format. This stylesheet is based on the GML2RDF.xsl stylesheet (which is included in this folder) proposed by Linda van den Brink, Paul Janssen, and Wilko Quak in their article "From Geo-data to Linked Data: Automated Transformation from GML to RDF".
