## XML to OWL Conversion
This folder contains sample data used to test XML to owl conversions via python and XSLT.

### Input Data
GML files used for testing are located in the _input-data_ folder. They consist of cityGML data from the metropole of Lyon. Generic and Appearance nodes have been removed from their XML trees.

### XSLT
XSL transformations are done using [Saxon-HE](http://saxon.sourceforge.net/) which is dependent on Java

##### Generate_XML2RDF.xsl
This stylesheet is used to create an XML to RDF XSL stylesheet from an XML Schema document.

##### CityGML2RDF.xsl
CityGML2RDF is an XSLT stylesheet to transform CityGML 2.0 files into RDF/XML format. This stylesheet is generated by the _Generate_XML2RDF.xsl_ stylesheet from the ../XMLSchema/compositeCityGML.xsd Schema.

Requires Java 8+

To convert a GML file:
```
java -jar ../saxon9he.jar -s:[gml file to transform] -xsl:CityGML2RDF.xsl > [file to output]
```

### CityGML2RDF.py
A pythonic approach to transformation. This approach requires an ontology (located in the UD-Graph/Ontologies folder) to determine how to convert nodes into RDF triples. If gml leaf nodes are found they are also converted into GeoSPARQL's gmlLiteral datatype

Required libraries: _lxml, copy_

To convert all gml files in input-data folder:
```
GML2RDF.py
```
To convert a specific gml file:
```
GML2RDF.py [gml file to convert]
```

Output will be written to the Results folder
