## XML to OWL Conversion
This folder contains sample data used to test XML to owl conversions via python and XSLT. XSLT transformations are done using [Saxon-HE](http://saxon.sourceforge.net/) which is dependent on Java.

### Input Data
GML files used for testing are located in the _input-data_ folder. They consist of CityGML data from the metropole of Lyon. Generic and Appearance nodes have been removed from their XML trees. **Note that input files must use the exact same namespaces and namespace prefixes as the XML Schema they conform to.**

##### Generate_XML2RDF.xsl
This stylesheet is used to create an XML to RDF XSL stylesheet from an XML Schema document.

##### CityGML2RDF.xsl
CityGML2RDF is an XSLT stylesheet to transform CityGML 2.0 files into RDF/XML format. This stylesheet is generated by the _Generate_XML2RDF.xsl_ stylesheet from the ../XMLSchema/compositeCityGML.xsd Schema.

Requires Java 8+
Python script is dependent on _lxml_ library to parse XML.

To convert a CityGML 2.0 or GML 3.1 datafile:
```
python run.py
```

Output will be written to the Results folder
