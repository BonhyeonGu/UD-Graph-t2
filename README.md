## CityGML 2.0 Ontology
CityGML 2.0 is an open, GML 3.1.1 based, OCG standard for representing city geometry, topology, and
appearance. As CityGML is an XML based format, it's hierarchy can be represented ontologically by
RDF and OWL schemas. This project creates a CityGML ontology based on the work already created
by the Université de Genève. See notes for further details.

The ontology also includes an extension of GeoSPARQL and it's own GML 3.2 ontology by means of
equivalent owl classes to GML 3.1.1.

CityGML 2.0 Ontology is edited using the [Protégé](https://protege.stanford.edu/) resource, which is
supported by grant GM10331601 from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences of the United
States National Institutes of Health.
