## CityGML 2.0 Ontology
CityGML 2.0 is an open, GML 3.1.1 based, OCG standard for representing city geometry, topology, and
appearance. As CityGML is an XML based format, it's hierarchy can be represented ontologically by
RDF and OWL schemas. This project will create a CityGML ontology based on the work already created
by the Université de Genève. See notes for further details.
