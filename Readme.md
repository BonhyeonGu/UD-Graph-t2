## Transformations
Contains the following implementations:
1. ShapeChange (UML-to-OWL)
   * ShapeChange configuration files for CityGML 2.0 and 3.0 UML models to RDF/OWL ontologies
2. XML-to-OWL
   * Scripts for converting XML files into RDF/OWL individuals based in Python
   * Scripts for converting XML files into RDF/OWL individuals based in XSLT
3. XSD-to-OWL
   * Scripts for converting XML Schema into RDF/OWL ontologies
4. test-data
   * Stores for test GML, RDF, OWL, and XML Schema data

## Ontologies
Contains the most up to date versions of several ontologies, including ontologies generated by XSLT transformations in the _CityGML_Transformations_ folder.

CityGML Ontology is edited using the [Protégé](https://protege.stanford.edu/) resource, which is supported by grant GM10331601 from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences of the United States National Institutes of Health.

## SPARQL Queries
Contains basic queries to be used on the RDF generated from XML to OWL scripts and their results.
